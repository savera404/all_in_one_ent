This is All-In-One Entertainment Recommendation system featuring Anime, Kdrama, Book and Movie recommendation systems. This is also deployed on streamlit cloud: https://all-in-one-ent.streamlit.app/
The deployed version does not contain Anime Recommender because it requires a very large file which the streamlit cloud is unable to process due to the size limitation in the free version, however, if you download this repository Anime Recommender should work. For that you will need to do these steps:
1) Move the anime.py file in the pages folder.
2) Uncomment the code in the all_in_one.py file
3) Install the gdown library in terminal.

In order to run this project you need to run the all_in_one.py file only.
